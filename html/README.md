# AMT Hit generation

## Support for new tasks

To add support to new tasks fill the task_dictionaries.py dictionaries with the appropriate task infos (look a the validity_4pt entries of the dictionaries).

You will need to add an instruction file which contains the instructions of the tasks formatted as html (look at ./instructions/validity_4pt.html for an example).
